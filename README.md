# how to Access attack surface


Notes from attending ISC2 Security Briefing: How to Perform an Attack Surface Assessment {1/17/2023}<br>
Step 1: Assess entry points to your assets<br><br>

Step 2: Assess the technologies that protect your entry points<br><br>

Step 3: You should create a data classification policy for your data and the assets that use it<br><br>

Step 4: Access the sensitivity of data that assets use.<br><br>

Business Case: Build a comphresive inventory of Assets<br>
Use CAse: Display a list of all asset inventory technologies <br><br>

Business Case: Ensure software agents are deployed and functioning.<br>
Use Case: Find assets missing agents (physical,virtual, server,endpoint, virtual)<br><br>

Business Case: Ensure vulnerability scannercoverage meets objectives<br>
Use Case: Find devices not being scanned by a vulnerability scan<br><br>

Business CAse: Assess SaaS services for risk to enterprise<br><br>
Use Case: <br>

CAASM - Cyber asset and attack suface Management (CAASM)<br>

- Focused on asset visibility and vulnerability challanges

- Shows all assets (internal and external) through API intergrations with existing tools
 - builds an inventory of all tools
 - Queries consolidated data to identify vulnerability scope and gaps in controls


Sanctioned SAAS Applications
- apps you trust and know 

Unsanctioned SAAS Applications
- apps that are unknown to you for instance is my data at risk if they suffer a breach<br>

It's important to be knowledageable about unsanctioned SaaS because they are unknown parts of your attack surface. And is key to know where you can get the information to learn which unsanctioned apps your clients are using<br>
